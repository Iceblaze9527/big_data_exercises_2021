    "\n",
    "As explained in the tutorials, to change HDFS configurations you edit `etc/hadoop/core-site.xml` and `etc/hadoop/hdfs-site.xml`. In the docker app, you can modify the variables in the `hadoop.env`.  For example the following line\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "# hadoop.env \n",
    "CORE_CONF_fs_defaultFS=hdfs://namenode:9000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`CORE_CONF` corresponds to `core-site.xml`. and the second part `fs_defaultFS=hdfs://namenode:9000` will be transformed into:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<property>\n",
    "    <name>fs.defaultFS</name><\n",
    "    value>hdfs://namenode:9000\n",
    "    </value>\n",
    "</property>\n",
    "```\n",

    "For more details [see here](https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hadoop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Try changing the default block size of HDFS to see its affect on read & write performance. You can change the block size by modifying the follwoing line in `hadoop.env`:\n",
    "`HDFS_CONF_dfs_block_size=1048576`\n",
    "The value `1048576` determines the block size in bytes, which in this case is `2^20 bytes` or 1 megabytes.\n",
